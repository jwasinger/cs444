Processes:
	Similar to Linux:
		-> Processes create child processes
		-> Processes have PIDs
		-> Kernel Stack

Threads:
	Different from Linux:
		-> Distinct relationship between threads and processes
			Reason:
			Keeping everything as a process simplifies things (linux is elegant).

		-> FreeBSD threads can share all process resources including PID (in their lightest form)

	Similar to Linux:
		-> Adoption of pthread standard
			Reason:
			Increased portability

		-> Kernel Threads
	Scheduling in Linux:
		-> vruntime is determined per-thread based on (...)
		-> process (task) with lowest vruntime is chosen next
		-> an rb-tree is for efficiency (expand here).
		-> Context Switching
	
	Scheduling in FreeBSD:
		-> CPU time is determined based on scheduling class and scheduling priority
			* scheduling class (...)
			* scheduling priority (...)
		-> Context Switching: 
			* Voluntary vs Involuntary (99)
	Similar to Linux:
		Thread/Process priority is somewhat `tunable` by the user
